Proactive and creative professional, with a huge passion for Information Technology. Recently achieved a Second-Class degree in Computer Science in summer 2021. During my studies, I have been freelancing and working with several high-end brands such as Printwell, Utility Warehouse, Greensleeves Lawn Care, and more. Within this time, I have amassed a wealth of experience and skills across Technical Support, Software Development, UX/UI design, Customer Service, Business Operations, Leadership, and Management.

I have also been working on several non-profit projects, in the last few years, such as the Learning Management Platform which is planned to help students in third-world countries such as Yemen access free education.
